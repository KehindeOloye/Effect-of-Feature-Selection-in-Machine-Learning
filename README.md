# Effect-of-Feature-Selection-in-Machine-Learning

This work includes java code for the work titled "A Study on the Effect of Feature Selection on Malware Analysis using Machine Learning," a work accepted for publication and presentation at the ACM 8th International Conference on Educational and Information Technology (ICEIT) 2020 held between 2nd-4th March, 2019, at University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.
In this work the effect of feature selection in malware detection using machine learning techniques is studied. We employ supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms with and without feature selection. These include both classification and clustering algorithms.
