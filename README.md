# Effect-of-Feature-Selection-in-Machine-Learning
This work includes java code for  effect of feature selection in malware detection using machine learning techniques is studied. We employ supervised and unsupervised machine 
learning algorithms with and without feature selection. These include both classification and clustering algorithms.
